# **GP Practice Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to apply **unsupervised machine learning** techniques, specifically **K-Means clustering** and **Hierarchical clustering**, to segment **General Practitioner (GP) practices** based on **Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) performance measures** and other **demographic markers**. By identifying meaningful clusters, this analysis will help uncover patterns in healthcare performance and inform targeted interventions.

## **Objectives**
- Explore and preprocess **QOF performance data** and **demographic indicators**.
- Apply **K-Means** and **Hierarchical clustering** to group GP practices into meaningful segments.
- Evaluate the clustering results to identify patterns and insights.
- Visualize and interpret the clusters for actionable recommendations.

## **Project Status**
ðŸŸ¢ **Ongoing** (Early Stages)  
- **Data collection**: In progress  
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**: Not started  
- **Feature selection**: Not started  
- **Clustering implementation**: Not started  
- **Evaluation and visualization**: Not started  

## **Data Sources**
The analysis will utilize publicly available data, including but not limited to:
- **Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)** â€“ Performance measures of GP practices.
- **Demographic Data** â€“ Population characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and regional variations.
- **Additional Datasets** â€“ Any relevant healthcare indicators.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect and preprocess **QOF and demographic data**.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize features.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Select relevant performance and demographic metrics.
   - Apply **dimensionality reduction (if needed)** to improve clustering performance.

3. **Clustering Techniques**
   - Implement **K-Means clustering** to segment GP practices.
   - Use **Hierarchical clustering** for alternative segmentation and comparison.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Compare clustering results and interpret key patterns.

5. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Generate **heatmaps**, **scatter plots**, and **geospatial maps** to illustrate cluster characteristics.
   - Summarize findings to inform policy recommendations.
